# Morp's

## Overview

Morp's is a dynamic tic-tac-toe game built with React. Unlike the classic tic-tac-toe, once each player has placed their third piece, the next move will involve moving the oldest piece to a new position. The victory condition remains the same: align three pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game features:
- **Two-player mode:** Play against another person.
- **Player vs AI mode:** Play against a basic AI.
- **Profile Management:** Login with email and password (currently simulated).
- **Online Multiplayer:** Matchmaking 1v1 (Elo system soon) (Need Morp's server to play)
